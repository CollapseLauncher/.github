# HSR HDR Issue
We have noticed some issues for those who are using HDR monitor and having it on while playing the game. This has been patched by HoYo and available through official launcher. Currently we are in progress of making this patch available for Collapse Launcher, but this might take a while to be up and distributed.

For those affected, you can patch your own client and extracting the zip files provided below to the game installation folder. This way, the file `data.unity3d` will be replaced by new one.
